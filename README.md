- `/convex/auth.ts`
  - Handles storing user data (name, email, avatar) on login

- `/convex/upload.ts`
  - generateUploadUrl() — generates Convex upload URL for image

## 📱 UI/UX Guidelines

- Clean, minimal, Instagram-inspired layout
- Use soft shadows, rounded avatars, and responsive design
- Feed cards show user avatar + name + time, post image, and post text
- Implemented with StyleSheet styles for consistency
